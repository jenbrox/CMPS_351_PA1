## This program provides unit conversions from degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius, Celsius to Fahrenheit, and pounds to kilograms. The user is prompted to select the type of conversion they need from a menu and the converted rate is provided to them on the print screen. The program will continue and the menu will be shown to the user until the user provides the exit option.
